# Pair-Sum

Here we're going to find the sum of pairs of elements from a given list/array to match with target.
example:
        [2,7,11,15] is the list
        here taget --> 9
        pair = (0,1) indexe's

Note: In this code we're going to write logic where the pair of elements will not get repeated to match with target.

example: 
        [5,4,3,2,3]
        taget --> 6

        Pairs -- (1,3) Accepted.
        But
        (2,4) Not Accepted.
